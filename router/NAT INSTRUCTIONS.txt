Address & Port mapping behaviour
  NAT MUST HAVE Endpoint-Independent mapping
    (X:x)->(X1:x1) for all external (Y2:y2)

ONLY INTERNAL CREATE MAPPING

Internal Initiated
  Initiates TCP by sending a SYN for 3 way
    Allocate/Resuse mapping
      Syn-ACK returned
        ACK sent back
  Initiate simultaneous tcp by sending syn in both direction
    same shit as above, just modify state properly

External Initiated
  MUST HAVE endpoint-independant filtering
    create conn only if mapping exists for:
      all connection initiation from all (Y2:y2) to a mapped (X1:x1)->(X:x)
  If filtered SYN: (not allowed)
    2 options:
      ignore silently
        more reliable for simultaneous open
      send ICMP
        fuck that
  If no mapp exists
    check for syn
      wait 6 seconds
        if mapping made
          drop syn silently
        else
          send ICMP port unreachable (3,3)
